# iOS11-Objective-C-Review

I took a few minutes after class to create an app to display comics from the XKCD API call that we wrote in class. I modified it to pull a random comic from XKCD and display it full screen.

To run this app:
  1. clone this repository
  2. use Xcode to open the XKCD project
  3. install on a device
